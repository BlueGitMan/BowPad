First, you need to install the compiler package.

- You need VS2019.

You can build BowPad directly by opening the solution file in VS2019.

If you want to build the installer, you need some utilities:
- TortoiseGit           : https://tortoisegit.org/
- WiX (*)               : https://wixtoolset.org/
- NAnt (*)              : http://nant.sourceforge.net/

(*) Add the paths of the binaries to the PATH environment variable
    You may have to logoff/logon to make the new environment variables take effect!


Now you're almost ready. Only a few more steps to do:
- Make a copy of the file default.build.user.tmpl in the BowPad root folder and
  rename that copy to default.build.user. Then adjust the paths as mentioned
  in that file.


Building packages

  Hint: before you can start building BowPad, you need to call the vsvars32.bat
  file which is located in %VS142COMNTOOLS%.

  > nant
  will compile BowPad and create the msi installer

  If you encounter any build errors, you can run nant again like this:

  > nant -l:buildlog.txt

  which will create a build log file which you can use to analyse where
  exactly the build failed.


  After the script finished, the packages can be found in .\bin.
